My solutions for advent of code 2025




## Retrospective
Glad I finally got to doing AoC as I finally didn't forget when it started.

The 2 stars I didnt get: 
- Star number 9 - I felt like I got too deep into the computational geometry rabbit hole and I lost motivation dealing with all the edge cases. 
- Star number 10 - I can get the singular matrix that describes the problem, but I dont have experience with SMT solvers to solve it over integers and to me it goes against the spirit of the challenge anyways. 

I will probably participate next year again.
